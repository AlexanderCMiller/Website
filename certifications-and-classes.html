            <p class="text"><b>Eagle Scout Service Project Leader</b></p>
            <p class="text"><i>Scouts BSA, Lexington, VA, (July 2023-February 2024)</i></p>
            <p class="text">As an Eagle Scout Candidate, I planned, revised, and executed an Ealge Scout Service Project for Natural Bridge State Park (NBSP).</p>
            
            <p class="text">Work involved meeting with a beneficiary representative from NBSP, talking to them about the project, conducting R & D for a project proposal, reviewing the R & D with the beneficiary, and revising and editing based on what they said. Then, signatures needed to be acquired from the beneficiary and various important BSA representatives to move forward. </p>

            <p class="text">A materials, supplies, tools, and other-needs list was put together for any & all possible needs for the project. This was edited based on the comments made by the signers of the proposal. A project plan was then set into place. This involved coordinating dates and times for the project, and dates & times before the project to get things ready for the project workday. Materials & tools needed to be purchased and prepared before the project workday. Additionally, tools and other needs were requested as donations from other parties. </p>
            
            <p class="text">Before a test build was conducted, I had to put together complete plans of the storage boxes with schematics, specific cut lengths, and the materials, supplies, and tools that were associated with building the boxes. In addition, a cost estimate was to be formulated based on these requirements. </p>
    
            <p class="text">Then a preliminary design of the storage boxes to be installed for NBSP was put together, so I could know how to create an assembly, transport, and installation plan. This plan would have to include clear instructions on how to do all of these aforementioned things, and I would need to include what tools, and what parts would be needed in each step. In total, the assembly instructions were 62 steps long. </p>
    
            <p class="text">After all of this, I created some simple safety guidelines for the project so that I could maintain safety during the project workday. Two weeks ahead of the project workday, I continued coordinating with my troop so they would have all the details they needed about the project, and I coordinated with NBSP to make sure they were completely on board with everything that was happening on the project workday.</p>

            <p class="text">Finally, the workday came, and I was the leader of the project. I was responsible for instructing everyone on how to build the storage boxes, how to use tools, how to stay safe in the work environment, and how to ensure the quality of the finished storage boxes was up to specifications. I also oversaw the loading, transport, unloading, and installation of the boxes at the installation sites at NBSP. With the project completed, and the beneficiary satisfied, I thanked everyone for coming and proceeded to type up my Eagle Scout Service Project Report.</p>
