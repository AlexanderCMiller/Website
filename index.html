                    <p class="text">Hello, I am so happy that you decided to visit my personal website.</p>
                    <p class="text">
                        This website was created to advertise my interests and to publish my “resume” online. Keep in mind that I don’t have much to add to a “resume” as I am still in school at this time. To access my "credentials," click on the cybersecurity tab and then
                        select the "Resume (Certifications and Courses)" article link.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        I will occasionally update this website, so if a section of this page is gone that you previously had looked at, it is because I have changed the website configuration. Most likely I will not delete sections entirely from this site. 
                        Again, thank you for visiting this site!
                    </p>
