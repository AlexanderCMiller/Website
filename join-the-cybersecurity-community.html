            <p class="text">If you don’t know what “cybersecurity” is, then here is a definition from cisco.com:
                <br>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These <a class="links" href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/common-cyberattacks.html" target="_blank">cyberattacks</a> are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users via <a class="links" href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-ransomware.html" target="_blank">ransomware</a>; or interrupting normal business processes.
                <br>Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.
                <br> ("What is Cybersecurity")
            </p>
            <p class="text">Reasons to Enter the Cybersecurity Field:</p>
                <ul class="text">
                    <li>If you like to learn new things all the time; if you are a lifelong learner</li>
                    <li>If you enjoy helping other people, then join the cybersecurity community to help your family and friends keep their data safe, private, and away from prying eyes.</li>
                    <li>Cybersecurity is not just about “that nerdy guy that sits at his computer every day,” there are so many jobs in the field that can be so much more active and interesting!</li>
                    <li>If you are interested in a fast-paced job that often deals with the bleeding edge of technology, then the cybersecurity field is for you.</li>
                    <li>If you are deeply interested in computer hardware, software, or electronics, the cybersecurity field may suit you.</li>
                </ul>
            <p class="text">Pros of the Cybersecurity Field:</p>
                <ul class="text">
                    <li>Some positions offer <b>High Pay.</b></li>
                    <li>Possibility for <b>Flexible Schedules</b></li>
                    <li><b>Personal Knowledge</b> allows you to make better security policies for yourself and allows you to make better purchasing decisions regarding software or hardware for computers and networks.</li>
                    <li><b>Low Unemployment</b> due to the “…3.4 million open cybersecurity [positions] worldwide in 2022 alone]” (Izlar)!</li>
                </ul>
        <h2 class="sectiontitletext">What Should You Do to Prepare for the Cybersecurity Field?</h2>
            <img class="imgathome" src="https://acm-alexander-c-miller.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bePrepared.jpg"> <p class="text"><i>The Scouts BSA Motto is: “Be Prepared!” You should “be prepared” to enter the cybersecurity field.</i></p>
            <p class="text"> <b>Summary of Education and Certifications Recommended:</b></p>
                    <p class="text">Education:</p>
                    <ul class="text">
                        <li>The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outreach Handbook (OOH) recommends that you get “…a [Bachelor’s Degree] in computer and information technology or …engineering or math” (“How to Become One”).</li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="text">Certifications (certs):</p>
                <ul class="text">
                    <li>Security+ (“How to Become One”)</li>
                    <li>Certified Information Systems Professional (CISSP) certification (“How to Become One”)</li>
                    <li>According to an infield expert, someone should only get a cert in something new so that they gain skills and knowledge, and not stress over the cert if their course already covered the cert content (Infield Expert “A”).</li>
                </ul>
            <p class="text"><b>Expansion of Education and Certifications</b></p>
                <p class="text">According to the Bureau of Labor Statics’ website, bls.gov, many cybersecurity jobs, such as information security analyst, as an example, require a Bachelor’s Degree (“Computer and IT Occupations”). The Occupational Outreach Handbook states that an ISA “…typically [needs] a [Bachelor’s Degree] in computer and information technology or …engineering or math” (“How to Become One”).</p>
                <p class="text">Interestingly, they also say that “…some workers enter the occupation with a high school diploma and relevant industry certifications” without any degree (“How to Become One”). This is fascinating because it suggests that someone may be able to save a lot of money by not having the expense of college, but instead have relevant experience or certifications (certs) to do the job. The OOH recommends certs for many cybersecurity positions, including an ISA, which includes a Security+ or a Certified Information Systems Professional (CISSP) certification (“How to Become One”). </p>
                <p class="text">To clarify these mixed messages, I conducted some personal interviews with infield experts. I have permission to cite one of them by name in this article at this time. Currently, I am working to obtain permission from the other interviewee so that I can give them credit as well.</p>
                <p class="text">One of my infield interviewees detailed the steps to geting the educational experience you need to enter and be successful in the cybersecurity field:
                    <br>If you are going a traditional route, going from high school to an IT…field, you need to start with [a professional certification] …so you have that foundational knowledge of what IT consists of.
                    <br>(Bryan Secoy — BS in CS, BARC Electric IT Specialist)
                </p>
                <p class="text">He goes on to say that if you are taking a nontraditional route, a bachelor’s degree can substitute the cert because the key is to gain knowledge, with or without the certification.</p>
                <p class="text">My other interviewee (Let’s call them Infield Expert “A”) reported that someone should only get a cert in something new so that they gain skills and knowledge, and not stress over the cert if their course already covered the cert content.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Internships</b></p>
                <p class="text">Summary of Internship Opportunities:</p>
                    <ul class="text">
                        <li>“…federal internships [that] are within the intelligence (IC) agencies” (Dalziel 40)</li>
                        <li>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) advertises that they are “…hiring current students enrolled in accredited education institutions from high school to graduate level for paid cyber/IT internships” (“Cyber and IT Interns”).</li>
                        <li>Look for local opportunities that are advertising internships opportunities that will allow you to gain legitimate experience in the cybersecurity field.</li>
                    </ul>
            <p class="text"><b>Expansion on Internships</b></p>
                <p class="text">Doing a legitimate cybersecurity internship can allow you to gain experience and skills before entering the cybersecurity field. 
                    Beneficial cybersecurity internships include “…federal internships [that] are within the intelligence (IC) agencies” according to Henry Dalziel, who wrote an Introduction to US Cybersecurity Careers which explores options that are available for people looking into the cybersecurity field (Dalziel 40).
                    One federal agency that is interested in hiring people for cybersecurity internships is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). 
                    CISA advertises that they are “…hiring current students enrolled in accredited education institutions from high school to graduate level for paid cyber/IT internships” (“Cyber and IT Interns”). 
                    This is important for people aiming to enter the field because they will have many opportunities to meet industry leaders, develop hands-on skills, and learn on the job while working on real cybersecurity issues related to national security (“Cyber and IT Interns”). 
                    Since CISA offers internships to high schoolers, young people get experience that will help them in their cybersecurity careers.

        <h2 class="sectiontitletext">How Should You Get Connected with People Already in the Cybersecurity Field?</h2>
            <img class="imgathome" src="https://acm-alexander-c-miller.000webhostapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2_network_fibre_optic_connections.jpg"> <p class="text"><i>Computer networking has similarities to social networking. Both require knowledge to be successful.</i></p>
            <p class="text">If you know someone who is already in the field, then you should talk to them to get more insight on what the cybersecurity field is composed of, and if you are the right candidate for the field. If you are convinced that you would like to enter the industry, then you should ask them to elaborate on how they prepared and what recommendations they would like to share with you. For this reason, I talked to infield experts that I had personally known to get a better understanding of what the cybersecurity field is composed of.</p>
            <p class="text">I asked them many broad questions, but our conversations often deviated to talking at length about the specifics of solutions and threats in the industry. At the time, I wanted to know more about the specifics to understand what threats/solutions someone should know about before entering the cybersecurity field.</p>
            <p class="text">However, something that both my interviewees kept coming back to when I was asking them about current threats and solutions was how fast-paced the cybersecurity field moves at. I realized this because both interviewees corrected obsolete online research that I had conducted before interviewing them. They had told me “the problem,” which I thought was “a problem” was, in fact, not an issue anymore, but an alternate issue had taken its place. </p>
            <p class="text">This realization –that something that I thought was current, was obsolete– opened my eyes to just how fast the cybersecurity field moves at, and if you don’t make yourself out to be a lifelong learner, then you don’t have a chance to be successful in a cybersecurity career if you can’t stay up-to-date with the most recent vulnerabilities. With that being said, it is critical that you “learn to learn,” and learn to do it all the time because the cybersecurity field is always changing. </p>
            <p class="text">Although, that is not a bad thing, because it is always interesting when innovative technology is invented, and you are the first to experiment with it. Anyway, I will discuss more about my interviewees’ thoughts on the current state of the cybersecurity field in a later article that I publish on this website. For now, let’s look at cybersecurity organizations and events that you may be able to become involved in.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Cybersecurity Organizations and Events</b></p>
